= Introduction =

The End-User website is available at http://www.piccolo2d.org

= Domain =

Domain owner is http://code.google.com/u/willismorse/

= Content =
== Template ==
The content was adapted from http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/jazz/ with friendly permission.

== Version Management ==

The *complete* website content is versioned in the project's svn repository: http://piccolo2d.googlecode.com/svn/site

*Caution*: The site contains a huge number of documentation html pages (.Net and Javadoc, maven reports).

Publishing a (unchanged but newly generated) set of maven reports consumes *10 MB* of svn repository space and the commit takes *over 1 hour*.

Maybe we pick a git hosting solution for the website content in the future. 

== Staging area ==

The svn repository serves as a staging area. Therefore the svn:mime-type of all files must be set correctly. The script http://piccolo2d.googlecode.com/svn/site/tools/svn-mime-types.sh helps.

== Deployment ==

The content at www.piccolo2d.org is served from a checked out working copy backed with http://piccolo2d.googlecode.com/svn/site

A cron job (at piccolo2d.org) keeps the site up-to-date by running a "svn update" every 4 hours, namely a [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_UNIX/Explanations/Scheduling_Jobs#Crontab_format crontab] pattern of
