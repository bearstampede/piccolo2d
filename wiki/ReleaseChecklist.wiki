#summary Release checklist.

= Checklist =
===Verify Issues===
  # Verify that no Open issues exist with current release milestone:
    * [http://code.google.com/p/piccolo2d/issues/list?can=2&q=milestone=1.3.2&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Toolkit%20Component%20Summary Milestone:3.1,Open issues]
  # Verify that no Fixed issues exist with the current release milestone
    * (All closed issues should be in Duplicate, WontFix, or Verified status
    * [http://code.google.com/p/piccolo2d/issues/list?can=1&q=Milestone:1.3.2%20status=Fixed&sort=status&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Toolkit%20Component%20Summary Milestone:3.1,status=Fixed]
===Verify build===
  * For each of {beta, rc1, rc2, ...} release candidates:
    # Verify that working directory builds and all tests pass on all platforms:
{{{
$ mvn install
}}}
    # Verify that the examples run with the specified jdk version on all platforms
{{{
$ cd examples
$ mvn assembly:assembly
$ java -jar target/piccolo2d-examples-1.3.2-rc1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
}}}
    # Verify that the SWT examples run with the specified jdk version on all platforms
{{{
$ cd ../swt-examples
$ mvn assembly:assembly
$ java -jar target/piccolo2d-swt-examples-1.3.2-rc1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
}}}
    # Verify that {{{clirr}}} report shows no ERRORs where binary compatibility is required
      * For example, for minor release version 1.3.2, core must be binary compatible with the latest minor release version, 1.3.
{{{
$ clirr.sh --old-version piccolo2d-core-1.3.1.jar --new-version piccolo2d-core-1.3.2-rc1.jar --style text
}}}
    # Verify that all source files have the Piccolo2D license header
    # Class file format of all jar files matches the minimum required JDK version, currently 1.4
      * _Note: I did this by unzipping the built jars and using {{{javap}}}; there may be a better way to do this verification, or perhaps we should author a script._
    # Update release notes and readme as necessary
