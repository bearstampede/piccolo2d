the following is a quick brain.dump of mine - *please edit & comment recklessly* without asking. In case it's all versioned. Still.

= Goals =

the following may not all be of equal importance, nor in be in any order:

  # keep history (code)
  # keep authorship per line a.k.a. blame/praise (code)
  # keep history (website)
  # keep authorship per line a.k.a. blame/praise (website)
  # clean up author names (e.g. I used at least 3 different ones during the years)
  # keep & update wiki pages
  # keep open issues
  # keep closed issues
  # keep issue-revision relations
  # split into per-language repositories

= Hosting =

ranging from 

  # hosted (until hoster shuts down) (e.g. github, bitbucket, source forge, etc.)
  # hosted with option to move to self-hosting (e.g. [http://gitlab.org gitlab])
  # self hosted ([http://fossil-scm.org/ fossil], gitlab, gitorious, ?)

= SCM =

  # git
  # mercurial
  # [http://fossil-scm.org/ fossil]
  # ?
