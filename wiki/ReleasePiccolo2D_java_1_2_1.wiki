== Changelog ==

piccolo/src

PPickPath
	* Fixed incorrect comment on nextPickedNode method

piccolo/extras
	* Added PSwing support for embedding Swing components (experimental)
	* Added package level javadoc comments

Specific PSwing fixes:
	* PSwingEventHandler: Applied patch from Maarten Billemont that fixes the issue by not applying the camera's transform to input events when the node is not a descendant of a PLayer object.
	* PSwing: Sam Reid - API improvement (so that PSwing can be constructed without the destination PSwingCanvas as constructor arg). Old constructor is deprecated for compatibility with existing code.
	* PSwingCanvas: Sam Reid - minor change to facilitate adding/removal of pswing from canvas.

PFrame
	* Fixed bug in PFrame where canvas size didn't follow containing PFrame size

PNavigationEventHandler
	* Made PNavigationEventHandler.directCameraViewToFocus set the focus to the specified focus node

PFixedWidthStroke
	* Added fix to PFixedWidthStroke to make dashes also fixed to go along with the width.

LineShape
	* Fixed bug in intersects - accessed X instead of Y. Contributed by Sebastian Graca
