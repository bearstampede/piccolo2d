INTRODUCTION
	
This example actually consists of several small examples that illustrate many of the features
that PocketPiccolo.NET provides.  These examples are all relatively short and are intended to show
you how to use the framework rather than create real applications.  The examples provided here
cover some of the basic elements of Piccolo.NET, including nodes, events, activities, clipping,
cameras, handles, selection, lenses and more.  Studying the code in each of these short examples
is a great way to start learning how to use PocketPiccolo.NET.


RUNNING THE CODE

Copy the contents of the bin directory to your device.  This includes to .dll files and one .exe
file.  On your device tap the file named "PocketPiccoloFeatures.exe."  When you start the project,
a window will open with a button for each of the examples included.  Simply click on the button of
the example you would like to run.


SOURCE

The source code is contained in the "./Source" directory.  If you would like to view the source,
double click on the "PocketPiccoloFeatures.sln" file to open the Visual Studio project.  You will
see there is a separate code file for each of the examples.  Simply double click on the one you
