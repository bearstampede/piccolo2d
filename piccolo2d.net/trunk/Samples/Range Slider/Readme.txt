INTRODUCTION
	
This example shows how Piccolo.NET can be used to create an interactive Control (i.e., widget)
which can then be used within the Visual Studio Form Designer to build an application - 
including firing events based on changes within the Control model.

This code creates a "Range Slider" which is a slider with two values, a "Low" and "High"
property, each of which can be modified by separate "thumbs".

RUNNING THE CODE

If you downloaded the compiled source, open the "./Bin" directory and double click the file
named "RangeSliderTester.exe."

If you checked out Piccolo.NET from CVS or downloaded the source distribution, you will need
to build the project in Visual Studio before running the code.


SOURCE

The source code is contained in the "./Source" directory.  If you would like to view the source,
double click on the "RangeSlider.sln" file to open the Visual Studio project.
