INTRODUCTION
	
This example builds a simple, but impressive fisheye-interaction based calendar application.
The user may click on a day to give that day focus.  The day that was selected will then animate
to a larger size while the surrounding days shrink, creating a tabular fisheye distortion effect.


RUNNING THE CODE

If you downloaded the compiled source, open the "./Bin" directory and double click the file
named "TabularFisheye.exe."

If you checked out Piccolo.NET from CVS or downloaded the source distribution, you will
need to build the project in Visual Studio before running the code.


SOURCE

The source code is contained in the "./Source" directory.  If you would like to view the source,
double click on the "TabularFisheye.sln" file to open the Visual Studio project.
