INTRODUCTION
	
This example uses PiccoloDirect3D to build a simple graph with some random nodes and connected
edges.  The nodes are highlighted on mouseover and an event handler allows users to drag them
around, keeping the edges connected.  Note, the "Graph Editor" example uses the standard Piccolo
packages to build the same interface.  


RUNNING THE CODE

If you downloaded the compiled source, open the "./Bin" directory and double click the file
named "GraphEditorDirect3D.exe."

If you checked out Piccolo.NET from CVS or downloaded the source distribution, you will need
to build the project in Visual Studio before running the code.


SOURCE

The source code is contained in the "./Source" directory.  If you would like to view the source,
double click on the "GraphEditorDirect3D.sln" file to open the Visual Studio project.
