INTRODUCTION
	
This example actually consists of several small examples that illustrate many of the features
that Piccolo.NET provides.  These examples are all relatively short and are intended to show
you how to use the framework rather than create real applications.  For sample applications,
see the other projects in the "Samples" directory of the Piccolo.NET distribution.  The
examples provided here cover all of the basic elements of Piccolo.NET, including nodes, events,
activities, layout, clipping, cameras, handles, selection, lenses and more.  Studying the code
in each of these short examples is a great way to start learning how to use Piccolo.NET.


RUNNING THE CODE

If you downloaded the compiled source, open the "./Bin" directory and double click the file
named "PiccoloFeatures.exe."

If you checked out Piccolo.NET from CVS or downloaded the source distribution, you will need
to build the project in Visual Studio before running the code.

When you start the project, a window will open with a button for each of the examples included.
Simply click on the button of the example you would like to run.


SOURCE

The source code is contained in the "./Source" directory.  If you would like to view the source,
double click on the "PiccoloFeatures.sln" file to open the Visual Studio project.  You will see
there is a separate code file for each of the examples.  Simply double click on the one you
would like to see.  If you don't see any code, press F7 to switch to the code view.
