          A Structured 2D Graphics Framework
        </h1>
        <p>
          <em>Welcome to Piccolo!</em> A revolutionary way to create robust, full-featured
          <em>graphical applications</em> in Java and C#, with striking visual effects such as
          <em>zooming, animation</em> and <em>multiple representations</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Piccolo is a toolkit that supports the development of 2D structured graphics programs, in
          general, and Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUIs), in particular. A ZUI is a new kind of
          interface that presents a huge canvas of information on a traditional computer display by
          letting the user smoothly zoom in, to get more detailed information, and zoom out for an
          overview. We use a "scene-graph" model that is common to 3D environments. Basically, this
          means that Piccolo maintains a hierarchal structure of objects and cameras, allowing the
          application developer to orient, group and manipulate objects in meaningful ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why use Piccolo? It will allow you to build structured graphical applications without
          worrying so much about the low level details. The infrastructure provides efficient
          repainting of the screen, bounds management, event handling and dispatch, picking
          (determining which visual object the mouse is over), animation, layout, and more.
          Normally, you would have to write all of this code from scratch. Additionally, if you
          want to build an application with zooming, that's built right into the framework too.
        </p>
        <p>
          What exactly is it? Piccolo is a layer built on top of a lower level graphics API. There
          are currently three versions of the toolkit: Piccolo.Java, Piccolo.NET and
          PocketPiccolo.NET (for the .NET Compact Framework). The java version is built on Java 2
          and relies on the Java2D API to do its graphics rendering. The .NET version is built on
          the .NET Framework and relies on the GDI+ API to do its graphics rendering. This makes it
          easy for Java and C# programmers, even those targeting PDAs, to build their own animated
          graphical applications. And best of all, Piccolo is <em>free</em> and <em>open
          source!</em>

        <b>Reduced effort on Piccolo</b> (Nov 1, 2006): We are reducing public support of Piccolo.
        We continue to use it internally and are aware of a number of external research and
        commercial uses of Piccolo. We will continue to distribute it open source and maintain the
        mailing lists, but we no longer have funds for continued development or help for others
        using Piccolo. We will be happy to continue to fold in external distributions, and do our
        best to maintain Piccolo, but with significantly reduced resources.
